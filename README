CS11 C++ Advanced: Ray Tracer
=============================

Written By: Ed Gonzalez  


This code will eventually be a ray tracer build for the CS11 C++ Advanced
track.  Submissions to labs can be found by tag (such as 'lab2' for lab #2).

---------------

The main program can eventually be built with 'make'
However, as only some base libraries have been written, this builds nothing.

Testing utilities can be built with 'make test', which includes the following:
* vector_test
* color_test

Both can be built at once with 'make all-full'
